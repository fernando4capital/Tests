# Architecture challenge
-------------------------
A clothing store, Lappos, is using an invoicing software, Libervoice, with inventory management capabilities for their 3 stores in Liberland. 

They want to bring their business online and have chosen Ifyshop as their platform.
 
Ifyshop has its own inventory management capabilities, a full-fledged REST API for all resources,
with webhooks on product updates and new orders and the ability to capture payments, 

but, unfortunately, it cannot issue invoices that are legally recognized in Liberland.
 
Libervoice can do this, so Lappos will keep using the software for their physical stores, 
and to invoice purchases online. 

However, Libervoice's API is fairly lacking;

it exposes only an endpoint for listing orders and products (with inventory), with pagination,
but no search, and another for creating invoices, but definitely no webhooks.
 
You're hired by Lappos to integrate these two systems and ensure that they can still sell their wares in their stores, 
but also online with legal invoicing, and while keeping the inventory in both systems synchronized.
 
Describe, in words, how you would tackle this problem. Consider:
 
1. Infrastructure costs, if any 
1.1 - Costs of Infraestucture will depend of the Lappos actual infraestructure that is not defined in the context, 
  so we will need a deeper analysis, the proposed scenario is not enough to a decision.  
  What is the budget? ( an Pre-sales approach could find this number).
      
2. Edge cases
  What kind of Database is runing the Store #1, #2 and #3 ?
  Is it possible to create a Data ETL Orchestration with this database?
  Is it possible to change the connection of the Ifyshop to read and write information and obey the Data ETL Orchestration?
  Is it better to create a Redirection of information using a new API layers instead of a Database layer?
  Is it possible to the Libervoice read information from a Data ETL Orchestestration or a soft-Datawarehouse?
  
3. Tradeoffs in implementation and why you took them
  The limitation of the layers (API/WEB/Data) will define the best appoach.
  The less interference in the 3rd part systems better. I prefer to create a layer of Business talking or Workflow Orchestration and keep their legacy intact.

# And a few questions
1. If you could work for any company in the world, which one would you choose? Why aren't you working there now?
I never thinked in bases of a company. I always look the challenges that I'll face and the return of payment for my time.
I had the opportunity of work in the biggest players and in startups, so that's not a filter to my choices.

2. When was the last time you changed your mind about something important? What triggered that change?
I'm a strategist by nature. I never do anything without have a plan of how get inside, and how to get outside of any situation or place.
After I take a decision, I don't have changes of mind, I basically obey my risk management with my "profit realization" vs "stop-loss" points, that 
will for sure be defined in another step of my plan.

3. Tell me about a time when you screwed up or made a mistake. How did you fix it and what did you learn?
Normally my mistakes are connected with trusting someone that is not totally involved in the same goal or mindset.
I did fix my mistakes using different tools to show EXACTLY what I have in mind, and also being very open of what is on my mind, and are my goals.
My last mistake was not paying full attention to the content of the Skoach Challenge, and as result I didn't deliver the best solution.
What I did to fix that, I find the focus, I did review the content of the test, and I replaced it with a new version. So, in resume... I did not give up! 
So, please when possible, check this new version of the code to the Challenge.

4. Among the people you've worked with, who do you admire and why?
- Melinda Fench Gates and Elena Cardone are two of the persons that I had an oppotunity to work with, and they both have the vision of 
how to build an Empire. The way they deal with people, creating a "tribe", where people look them with admiration is something of another level.
 
Thank you so much Jo√£o.

Success,
Fernando.
