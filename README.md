# Tests
tests, algorithms, and more, basically a place where I mess around :) 

# Skoach Challenge

The source code in Python to run.
main.py

There are 4 tests functions, one for each challenge.
* testExample_1()
* testExample_2()
* testExample_3()

Also, this is an extra test:
* testExample_4()

if you decide to run just remove 
the (#) comment symbol. 
It's a token of appreciation, and a way to show 
that I appreciate the opportunity to show a
little more of my skills as Software Developer.
